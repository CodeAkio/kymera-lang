# Null

To set a variable value as null in some languages, you can do it using the keyword 'nil' (ruby) or 'none' (python), but it's ugly and not objective, because when you think to set a null value you think in 'null' keyword. So Kimera use the key `null` like C# to it.

&#x20;**Syntax:**

```
<variable | constant | object> = null
```

&#x20;**Sample:**

```csharp
var number = 42
writeln(number)

number = null
writeln(number)

# 42
# null
```
