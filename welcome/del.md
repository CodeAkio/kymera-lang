# Del

You can use `del` to remove the variable, constants and objects from memory when you want, this is a cool and flexible Python resource that some other languages haven't. It increases your control, but remember that you have garbage collector to help you.

&#x20;**Syntax:**

```python
del <variable | constant | object>
```

&#x20;**Sample:**

```csharp
var number = 10
writeln(number)
# 10

del number
writeln(number)
# The variable 'number' was not declared.
```
