# Philosophy

Kymera use python \([PEP 20](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zen_of_Python)\) and ruby on rails \([DRY](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself) and [CoC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convention_over_configuration)\) philosophy.

Besides these philosophies, Kymera uses some of the [Unix Philosophy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_philosophy) below:

**Note:** In some cases, replace the word 'program' by module or package.

* Write programs that do one thing and do it well.
* Write programs to work together.
* Small is beautiful.
* Build a prototype as soon as possible.
* Choose portability over efficiency.
* Rule of Modularity.
* Rule of Composition.
* Rule of Separation.
* Rule of Simplicity.
* Rule of Parsimony.
* Rule of Transparency.
* Rule of Robustness.
* Rule of Representation.
* Rule of Least Surprise.
* Rule of Silence.
* Rule of Repair.
* Rule of Economy.
* Rule of Generation.
* Rule of Optimization.
* Rule of Extensibility.

Kymera also has its own philosophy:

* Ever use Kymera design pattern.
* Do more, write less.
* Make Kymera very secure and speed.
* Make standard library rich.
* Modern, flexible, powerfull and compact.
* Just import modules that you really need.
* Help us to make it a very good language.
* Stop to use Java now.
